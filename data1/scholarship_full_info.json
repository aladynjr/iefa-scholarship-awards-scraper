    "description": "In addition to the foundation’s program of support for postdoctoral research, ten or more\ndissertation fellowships are awarded each year to graduate students who would complete the writing of\na dissertation within the award year. These fellowships, in the amount of $20,000, are intended to\ncontribute to the support of the doctoral candidate to enable him or her to complete the thesis in a\ntimely manner and are only appropriate for students approaching the final year of their Ph.D. work.\nThis fellowship is not for support of doctoral research. Applications are evaluated in comparison with each\nother and not in competition with proposals for our research grant. Applicants may be citizens of any\ncountry and studying at colleges or universities in any country.\nQuestions that interest the foundation concern violence and aggression in relation to social change,\nintergroup conflict, war, terrorism, crime, and family relationships, among other subjects. Dissertations\nwith no relevance to understanding human violence and aggression will not be supported. Priority will\nalso be given to areas and methodologies not receiving adequate attention and support from other\nfunding sources.\nEligibility\nThese grants are made to Ph.D. candidates who are entering the dissertation stage of graduate\nschool. Usually, this means that fieldwork or other research is complete and writing has begun. If\nanalysis and writing are not far enough along for an applicant to be confident of completing the\ndissertation within the year, he or she should not apply, as the application will probably not be\ncompetitive with those that comply with this timetable. In some disciplines, particularly experimental\nfields, research and writing can reasonably be expected to be completed within the same year, and in\nthose cases it is appropriate to apply.\nTiming\nApplications for dissertation fellowships must be submitted by February 1. Applications are\nreviewed during the spring, with final decisions made by the Board of Directors at its meeting in June.\nApplicants will be informed promptly by email as well as letter of the Board's decision. Awards\nordinarily commence on September 1, but other starting dates (after July 1) may be requested if the\nnature of the project makes this appropriate.\nTaxation\nA recipient of a dissertation fellowship may be liable for income taxes on funds awarded, depending\non whether the funds are used to pay tuition and certain other related expenses, the amount of the\nrecipient's other income, the law of the recipient's domicile, and other factors. The foundation does\nnot provide advice on tax matters. Applicants should consult their own tax advisors to determine the\ntax consequences of receiving a dissertation fellowship.\nFinal Report\nRecipients of the dissertation fellowship must submit a copy of the dissertation, approved and\naccepted by their institution, within six months after the end of the award year. Any papers, books,\narticles, or other publications based on the research should also be sent to the foundation.",
    "otherCriteria": "Applications are submitted online. The application link can be found on our web site, hfg.org. The\ndirect address is https://www.grantinterface.com/hfg/Common/LogOn.aspx.

Late applications will not be considered.\n(We will still accept a mailed application using our previous application method, a printable PDF\nform, provided it arrives at the foundation’s office no later than February 1, or the following Monday if\nFebruary 1 falls on a weekend.)\nA. Project Title\nComplete all questions in this section that are applicable to your proposed project. Some questions\nare required; these are marked with an asterisk (*).\nB. Abstract and Survey\nEnter an abstract by typing or pasting text. (Note the length limit.) The abstract should be an\ninformative but succinct description of the project, including its relevance to aggression and/or\nviolence. The survey questions--about the topics, time period, and geographic region of your\nproject--are for statistical purposes only; this information does not affect our evaluation of the\napplication.\nC. Advisor's Letter and Advisor's Abbreviated C.V.\nA letter from your advisor must be uploaded by the advisor using our online system. In the section\nof the online application headed “Advisor Letter,” please follow the instructions to enter your\nadvisor’s email address and then click “Compose Email.” The system will prompt you to write an\nemail to your advisor asking that they provide a letter. We will then send your advisor an additional\nemail containing a link through which they may upload their letter. The letter should address the\nsignificance of the research and affirm that all requirements for the Ph.D. except the dissertation\nwill have been satisfactorily completed at the beginning of the award period and that preparation\nfor the dissertation is such that it will be completed within the academic year for which the\nfellowship is requested. (If this is not true, the advisor is doing the applicant no favor by saying it\nis. It would be better to encourage the advisee to wait until the appropriate time to apply.) The\nadvisor’s letter is due by February 15.\nPlease upload an abbreviated (two-page) version of your dissertation advisor's curriculum vitae.\n(You will not be penalized, however, if you are unable to shorten or obtain a shortened version of\nyour advisor's C.V.)\nD. Applicant's C.V. and Graduate School Transcript\nUpload your own curriculum vitae of no more than two pages in length. Please arrange for your\nuniversity to mail a copy of your official transcript to the foundation at the address below. The\ntranscript should arrive at the foundation’s office by February 15. If your Ph.D. program does not\ninvolve graded coursework, include an explanation of the university's requirements.\nE. Project Description\nDescribe guiding theories, methods, study populations, etc., and explain how the dissertation\nresearch augments your discipline's body of knowledge. If your analysis is far enough along that all\nor some of your findings can be conveyed, discuss them. This is a chance to convince the\nfoundation that a project is worth funding. Be concise, but give sufficient detail for a proper\nevaluation. Research plans are typically about 15 double-spaced pages (not including footnotes or\nreferences listed in a bibliography). Supplementary supporting material is not necessary but may be\nsubmitted.\n3\nF. Protection of Subjects\nIf your project’s subjects are living humans, or people with living relatives or associates whose lives\nmay be affected by the research, indicate what has been done to protect their safety or privacy. If\nsubjects are non-human animals, the foundation must be assured that you have avoided subjecting\nthem to unnecessary discomfort or harm. If your research involves documentary work concerning\npeople long dead or otherwise incapable of being harmed, this should be stated.\nG. Other Support\nDescribe facilities and resources already available for dissertation support. A Harry Frank\nGuggenheim Foundation Dissertation Fellowship may be accepted in conjunction with other\nawards, fellowships, or employment. A $20,000 fellowship can only contribute to the support\nneeded over the course of a year. Do you have other sources of support? Will you be working?\nHave you applied for other fellowships? Alternatively, it may be that a $20,000 award will support\nyou for full-time work for a few months. We like to see that an applicant has thought about these\npractical matters.\nFurther",

Scholarship candidates are judged on the basis of their academic records; recommendations offered from instructors, advisors, and employers; biographical records, which indicate academic honors; extracurricular interests, etc.\n\nAnnouncement of Winners\nIn July, a letter will notify scholarship winners.

In addition, all current recipients are given an honorary membership in the Printing Industries of America for the duration of their studies. Thus, they receive the same benefits that other Educational Members receive, such as discounts on Printing Industries of America products. PGSF students may post their résumés on printworkers.com for those who are seeking internships, part-time, or full-time employment. The Scholarship Selection Committee of PGSF will determine the amount of each scholarship. The amount of the scholarship is not made public.

The student’s record is reviewed at the end of each grading period and, if satisfactory, the award is extended for the following year. Students are required to maintain a cumulative “B” (3.0) average. If a student’s grades fall below this cumulative average, the student will be put on academic probation and the funds withheld until the grades are raised.

The letter should address the\nsignificance of the research and affirm that all requirements for the Ph.D. except the dissertation\nwill have been satisfactorily completed at the beginning of the award period and that preparation\nfor the dissertation is such that it will be completed within the academic year for which the\nfellowship is requested. (If this is not true, the advisor is doing the applicant no favor by saying it\nis. It would be better to encourage the advisee to wait until the appropriate time to apply.) The\nadvisor’s letter is due by February 15.\nPlease upload an abbreviated (two-page) version of your dissertation advisor's curriculum vitae.\n(You will not be penalized, however, if you are unable to shorten or obtain a shortened version of\nyour advisor's C.V.)\nD. Applicant's C.V. and Graduate School Transcript\nUpload your own curriculum vitae of no more than two pages in length. Please arrange for your\nuniversity to mail a copy of your official transcript to the foundation at the address below. The\ntranscript should arrive at the foundation’s office by February 15. If your Ph.D. program does not\ninvolve graded coursework, include an explanation of the university's requirements.\nE. Project Description\nDescribe guiding theories, methods, study populations, etc., and explain how the dissertation\nresearch augments your discipline's body of knowledge. If your analysis is far enough along that all\nor some of your findings can be conveyed, discuss them. This is a chance to convince the\nfoundation that a project is worth funding. Be concise, but give sufficient detail for a proper\nevaluation. Research plans are typically about 15 double-spaced pages (not including footnotes or\nreferences listed in a bibliography). Supplementary supporting material is not necessary but may be\nsubmitted.\n3\nF. Protection of Subjects\nIf your project’s subjects are living humans, or people with living relatives or associates whose lives\nmay be affected by the research, indicate what has been done to protect their safety or privacy. If\nsubjects are non-human animals, the foundation must be assured that you have avoided subjecting\nthem to unnecessary discomfort or harm. If your research involves documentary work concerning\npeople long dead or otherwise incapable of being harmed, this should be stated.\nG. Other Support\nDescribe facilities and resources already available for dissertation support. A Harry Frank\nGuggenheim Foundation Dissertation Fellowship may be accepted in conjunction with other\nawards, fellowships, or employment. A $20,000 fellowship can only contribute to the support\nneeded over the course of a year. Do you have other sources of support? Will you be working?\nHave you applied for other fellowships? Alternatively, it may be that a $20,000 award will support\nyou for full-time work for a few months. We like to see that an applicant has thought about these\npractical matters.",

Highest priority is given to research that can increase understanding and amelioration of urgent problems of violence and aggression in the modern world.\n\nQuestions that interest the foundation concern violence and aggression in relation to social change, intergroup conflict, war, terrorism, crime, and family relationships, among other subjects. Research with no relevance to understanding human problems will not be supported, nor will proposals to investigate urgent social problems where the foundation cannot be assured that useful, sound research can be done. Priority will also be given to areas and methodologies not receiving adequate attention and support from other funding sources.\n\nThe Research Grant\n\nMost awards fall within the range of $15,000 to $40,000 per year for periods of one or two years. Applications for larger amounts and longer durations must be very strongly justified. The foundation awards research grants to individuals (or a few principal investigators at most) for individual projects and does not award grants to institutions for institutional programs. Individuals who receive research grants may be subject to taxation on the funds awarded.Final decisions are made by the Board of Directors at its meeting in December. Applicants will be informed promptly by email as well as letter of the Board's decision.

While almost all recipients of our research grant possess a Ph.D., M.D., or equivalent degree, there are no formal degree requirements for the grant. The grant, however, may not be used to support research undertaken as part of the requirements for a graduate degree. Applicants need not be affiliated with an institution of higher learning, although most are college or university professors.\n\nApplication\n\nApplications are submitted online.

    "otherCriteria": "Taxation\nHFG awards research grants to individuals for individual projects. However, a grantee may\nchoose to have these funds administered through her institution for reasons of convenience and/or\nnecessity. If the grantee so directs, the grant will be administered and accounted for by the\ninstitution on behalf of the grantee in accordance with the budget prepared by the grantee and\nincluded with the application (subject to revisions approved by the foundation). Please see the\nsection below entitled “Individual vs. Institutional Applications” for detailed instructions.\nRegardless of whether the grant funds are paid to the grantee directly or paid to an institution on\nbehalf of the grantee, the grantee may be liable for taxes on funds awarded, depending on locality,\ntax status, timing, nature of the award, etc. Applicants should consult their own tax advisors to\ndetermine the tax consequences to them of receiving a research grant.\nEducation and Citizenship\nApplicants for a research grant may be citizens of any country. While almost all recipients of\nour research grant possess a Ph.D., M.D., or equivalent degree, there are no formal degree\nrequirements for the grant. The grant, however, may not be used to support research undertaken as\npart of the requirements for a graduate or doctoral program. Applicants need not be affiliated with\nan institution of higher learning, although most are college or university professors. \n2\nBudget Guidelines\nProposals should be accompanied by a precise budget. Please refer to the budget worksheet at\nhfg.org/rg/hfg_budget.pdf. This should be 1) downloaded, 2) completed and saved, and 3) then\nuploaded in the Budget section of the application. Your budget should cover only one year;\napplicants who are applying for two years of support will submit a detailed second-year budget if an\naward was granted for the first year. In addition to the budget worksheet, you will need to submit a\nbudget explanation that justifies each item in the worksheet.\nRequests will be considered for salaries, employee benefits, fieldwork, research assistantships,\nsupplies and equipment, essential secretarial and technical help, and other items necessary to the\ncompletion of a project. The foundation does not supply funds for overhead costs of institutions,\ntravel to professional meetings, self-education, elaborate fixed equipment, dissemination of research\nfindings, or—to repeat—graduate-degree research (except for salary for research assistants or funds\nawarded through our Dissertation Fellowship, described later). The foundation will not consider\napplications for the support of meetings or conferences.\nAs noted above, the majority of grants from the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation range\nbetween $15,000 and $40,000 per year, for one or two years, depending on the nature of the\nresearch. The size of our grants says something about the research we support. We aim to attract\napplications for projects that can be done within that range, and we expect budget requests to match\nthe specific needs of the project. We will not contribute a portion of costs to a project with other\nfunding unless an independent \"Guggenheim component\" of the research can be identified and\nshown to make a difference to what can be accomplished by the larger project, which must be fully\nfunded otherwise. Be aware that many solid pieces of research are proposed to us each year that can\nbe carried out well within these budget limitations; projects that require significantly more money are\nsimply not appropriate for funding by this foundation.\nSalaries\nIn general, a salary is only justified if paid work will be given up to free up time for the specific\nresearch project proposed to us. In these cases, we need to know the applicant’s base salary, the\nduties she is expected to fulfill, what she will give up in duties and salary to conduct the research\nproposed, and how that relates to the salary requested from us.\nHere are some general guidelines to follow when asking for salary support:\n• We generally do not fund projects that require an investigator’s full-time effort, except in\ncases of extended fieldwork, archival research, sustained writing projects, or other intensive\nwork.\n• We will consider requests for supplementation to a sabbatical half-salary, up to what we\nallow.\n• Requests for 2%, 5%, or even 10% of a researcher’s time appear to add nothing to the active\nscholarly engagement available for a project, especially when these requests come from\nuniversity professors whose salaries already cover time for research.\n• As most university professors are expected to conduct research during the time they do not\nteach, summer salaries are not a priority for the foundation and will be considered only with\nan adequate explanation for why the project cannot be conducted without such\ncompensation.\n• Request either salary or a per diem allowance during fieldwork, but not both.\n• Applicants without a salaried job should request a salary commensurate with local rates for\nsomeone with comparable qualifications. \n3\nFieldwork\nSince the foundation prefers to make contributions exclusively to the direct costs of research, we\ncommonly fund the costs of fieldwork, including travel, living expenses, local research assistance,\ninsurance, transcription costs, necessary software/equipment, visa fees, gifts/remuneration for\ninformants or survey participants, and other relevant expenditures. As with any other requests,\nthese items should be thoughtfully justified:\n• Requests for airfare/travel expenses should be accompanied, if possible, by documentation\nof the average price for economy class tickets.\n• When requesting funds for vehicle rental/local transportation, please give an approximation\nof how much these services will cost per day.\n• Per diem living expenses should represent an honest estimate of the costs of the research\nproposed. If an applicant is not familiar with the average living expenses where she will be\nworking, she might consult with regional experts. The U.S. Department of State web site\nprovides per diem rates by country, and the web site of the U.S. General Services\nAdministration (GSA) provides per diem rates by U.S. city. (These figures should be taken\nas guiding rather than binding.)\nResearch Assistance and Secretarial Help\nWe support research projects conducted by individuals, or a few principal investigators at most,\nwith student assistance or fieldwork help when necessary, for specific tasks appropriate to assistants.\nIf students are substantial collaborators on the project, we expect to review each one's c.v. and list of\npublications, as with other professional collaborators. Student assistants must be paid only for the\nwork they do, and at reasonable rates for junior researchers. We do not contribute to tuition or\nother university fees related to their status as students. Please do not try to hide tuition costs under\nthe category of \"benefits.\"\nFees for \"consultants\" are generally not allowed. If the principal investigator cannot do the\nwork without substantial expert advice, then we consider that she may not be the right person for\nthe project.\nIt is appropriate to ask for secretarial help if a research project entails clerical tasks that are\nspecific to that project. If so, describe that work and include a c.v. for the person to be employed.\nGeneral office support, calculated as a percentage of a secretary's regular salary, is not an allowable\nbudget item.\nEquipment and Supplies\nAsk only for equipment and supplies needed for this research project. While not all requests are\nas clearly fictional as the recent application with a budget line of $1,000 for \"pens, pencils, etc.,\" we\ndo not consider general office supplies to be essential to a research project. Nor do we want to\nsupply funds for a personal computer or any other equipment unless it is necessary to the project\nand unavailable otherwise. These restrictions exist in order to maximize the number of projects that\ncan be supported.\nApplication Procedure\nApplications are submitted online. The application link can be found on our web site, hfg.org.\nThe direct address is https://www.grantinterface.com/hfg/Common/LogOn.aspx. (Applications\nusing our older form, a printable PDF and its accompanying guidelines, will still be accepted if they\narrive at the foundation’s office by the deadline.)

    "description": "At the beginning of each term, most students enter deadlines and other due dates from all their courses onto a master calendar. During certain time periods, mostly the last couple of weeks of a semester, the calendar is crammed full of deadlines. Assuming that you have impeccable English skills, you are motivated for the assignment, nothing unexpected occurs, and you are a good writer, the rush of work is usually not a problem. However, those are a lot of very big “ifs.” Many people travel very far from home to attend a certain institution. Their conversational English may be very good, but their academic written English may not be as good. Motivation is often an issue as well. It is hard for a STEM student to write a thousand-word Faulkner paper. It is also hard for any student to find the energy to finish the third research paper assignment in the last month. Furthermore, illness, injury, adverse events at home, or just plain bad luck often come at just the wrong time.\n\n\nTo apply, you must be a student at an accredited college, university, community college, oct-tech certificate program, or any graduate or equivalent professional program. High school students who have just enrolled in college, are certainly eligible.",

So we're offering a $1000 scholarship for the best essay by a college student on that very topic.\n\nFor many students social media offers a way to make new friends and take a break from their studies. Some even use social networks to establish professional connections and enter the business world before graduating. Unfortunately sometimes social media can also lead to interrupted studying, unwanted drama and the destruction of one's reputation.\n\nWe hope our essay writing contest can be an opportunity for juniors and seniors to consider how they might have used social media differently but not just for the sake of reminiscing. Looking back on social media usage in one's early college years can be a way of using social media more effectively before leaving college. In addition, improving how one uses social media can be a boon as one enters the workplace and seeks new contacts while avoiding old mistakes.",

    "description": "Applications are now being accepted for the 2017/18 PhD program at the IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca (www.imtlucca.it), one of the six Schools of Excellence in Italy and one of the highest rated graduate schools in Europe according to the most recent E-Multirank survey.  Highly motivated candidates from all disciplines are invited to apply for one of the 36 fully-funded scholarships within a doctoral program that integrates scientific competences of economics, engineering, computer science, neuroscience and behavioral psychology, physics, applied mathematics, statistics, history and sciences of cultural heritage.\n\nThe three-year PhD program is articulated in four field-specific curricula that partially share a common scientific background and are directly linked to the School’s four scientific and research macro-areas. Candidates can apply for one (or more) of the following curricula:\n\n•\tAnalysis and Management of Cultural Heritage (AMCH)\n•\tCognitive, Computational and Social Neurosciences (CCSN)\n•\tComputer Science and Systems Engineering (CSSE)\n•\tEconomics, Networks and Business Analytics (ENBA)\n\nThis year, one PhD position is reserved for a candidate interested in writing his/her PhD thesis on economics and management within the context of a joint PhD agreement with the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven.\n\nCourses are led by world-renowned researchers and provide students with all the theoretical skills and advanced tools required for rigorously tackling a multitude of analysis, design and management problems within the broad framework of systems analysis in economic, social, scientific, technological and cultural domains. Specialized faculty and staff create a network that provides key guidance and support throughout the PhD Program. Working closely with faculty, both in the classroom and in the development of research, students reach the highest levels of scholarly achievement.  IMT School PhD graduates will be able to use the skills they acquired during their studies to recognize and resolve complex problems, to choose the most appropriate method or instrument to utilize when approaching these problems, even in disciplines outside of their primary field of research.  During their doctoral studies, students are also encouraged to carry out their research with the School’s Research Units. \n\nAll students are based in the recently restored San Francesco complex, a fully integrated Campus in the historical center of the beautiful Tuscan city of Lucca. The Campus includes renewed residential facilities, an on-site canteen, study and living rooms, a state-of-the-art library and outdoor recreational spaces, which foster a unique cultural, professional and social environment for our doctoral program. Eligible students, in addition to free room and board, will also receive a research scholarship which amounts to approximately €13,630/year. Additional funding for further research stages, including scholarships to cover an eventual fourth year to complete the PhD thesis, can be assigned on a competitive basis.\n\nThe PhD program at the IMT School attracts students from around the world, providing a truly international environment. English is the official language of the School. Moreover, all students will have the opportunity to spend periods abroad at research institutes, laboratories or universities, both within the Erasmus+ framework and through ad hoc mobility agreements.\n\nMost IMT School PhD Graduates have reached prominent roles in academics, governmental institutions, public and private companies or professions across the globe.\n\nTo find out more about the School, the admission requirements and how to apply, please see www.imtlucca.it/phd\n\nThe deadline for applications is July 31st, 6:00 pm Italian time.\n\nFind the IMT School on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and YouTube for the latest news.",

Although cracks with linear development are considered the most common pavement surface degradation found by road inspectors, other important surface defects like cracks with alligator pattern, potholes, routing, raveling, among others, represent important data about pavement surface condition to allow for an adequate quantitative and qualitative evaluation of road pavement surface degradation. Images of road surface taken using imaging systems composed of one regular camera (considered as been non-expensive imaging systems) have been used by researchers, mainly on the detection of cracks with linear development. However, these images are 2D data structures, been difficult to detect defects like potholes, routing or raveling when processing them, because the depth information along a profile of the road defect is missing. Light-field cameras, capturing light ray directions, have recently become available. The processing of the richer light field images allows a more complete analysis of the road pavement surface, for instance supporting depth estimation. An alternative/complementary sensor that can be used for road surface defect detection is a mobile Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). From this type of sensor a 3D point cloud, representing the transversal profiles of a road lane, can be created for the desired analysis. This project exploits the usage of these two types of imaging sensors. \nMore information can be found at: https://www.it.pt/Positions/OtherResearchPosition/5082",

Many scholars take the opportunity to study subjects they dropped at GCSE, or to go into more depth in their chosen degree subject, without the added pressure of A-levels. The study skills that can be gained from the exchange have proven to be beneficial at University: American teaching emphasises independence of thought, and discussions play a large part in the classroom.\n\nSSE is also as much a cultural exchange as an academic one. Host schools offer an extensive range of extracurricular activities and facilities, as well as American rites of passage such as spring break, prom, and graduation.

We work with quality Schools and Agencies throughout the world to make sure our students get the opportunity to apply for the pick of some of the best English Language teaching jobs around. \n\nThe specific duties and remuneration you can expect when teaching abroad obviously varies depending on a range of factors, for example: location, size of school, type of school (private or state), age of students etc. Remuneration will always be considerably higher than the UK Minimum wage. One of the key roles of our Job Advisory Service is to help you decide what position would suit you best.\nIf you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get in touch by email at:admin@englishlanguagecentre.org \n\n\n\n\n\nBasic Requirements:\nEnglish as a first language or equivalent\nGraduate or Undergraduate\nGood communication skills\nEnthusiasm about living and working abroad\nApplications will be judged on their own merits and we do not wish to be overly prescriptive in terms of what we are looking for. Essentially, we want to know why you want to teach abroad and why you believe you should receive a Scholarship place. Enthusiasm and commitment are more important than previous teaching experience (though that may also be taken into account), and we would like to encourage as many people as possible from all disciplines to apply.",

    "description": "The need for large-scale computations or for supporting large data-intensive calculations leads to the use of multiple (clusters of) parallel computers at different sites distributed across the Internet. The computational grid and cloud are examples of such distributed (possibly heterogeneous) computing systems and offer multiple hierarchical levels of parallelism: site, cluster, node, socket, core, vector, pipeline, and instruction1. Each level of parallelism requires at least a scheduler. For instance, at the cluster level there are batch schedulers and runtime systems. Depending on the level of parallelism, schedulers can be viewed as global and local. From a site level parallelism perspective, global schedulers distribute the computational tasks or the communication among the different sites, whereas local schedulers distribute the tasks or the communication among the computational nodes of a particular site. Furthermore, from the cluster level parallelism perspective, decisions made by the runtime system regarding the initial placement of application tasks to locally assigned computing resources can significantly influence the outcome of a cluster level scheduler. The scheduling goals differ from level to level and may be conflicting between levels. For instance, cluster level schedulers typically aim at maximizing fairness among all applications in terms of their execution time which may result in non-optimal execution times for certain applications. Application level schedulers typically aim at minimizing the execution time of a single application, which may result in non-balanced execution times among applications. Addressing the problem jointly at multiple levels is called multi-level scheduling and constitutes a multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem.",

    "description": "High performance computing systems consume and dissipate a great amount of power. Excessive heat dissipation requires aggressive cooling and extra space that adds to the power consumption and infrastructure cost. Moreover, as the sizes of the system as well as the system temperature rapidly increase, high system failure rates are observed. Thus, a feature of interest for scheduling scientific applications in such environments is support for fault detection and management. This characterizes the quality aspect of the time-to-solution. \nA solution to the application-level resilience to faults problem must meet the following requirements: (i) Efficiency, without compromising performance; (ii) The reliability level must be user controlled – greater reliability incurs a higher cost (either in terms of resources, CPU time, energy consumption, or allocation price); and (iii) Minimal code changes in the application. Scheduling algorithms that detect faults and are able to manage them are called fault tolerant (or resilient to faults). The most common fault tolerance strategies include task replication (via double or triple modular redundancy) and application checkpointing. However, it is unclear which of the existing solutions will scale to the size of the exascale computing systems expected by the beginning of the next decade.",

    "description": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that usually affects young and middle-aged adults and causes a considerable social and economic burden. During recent years MS has become one of the most common reasons for admissions to a neurological ward. Now MS is recognized throughout the world, with around 2.5 million affected individuals. Although the disease was recognized in the 19th century, there were limited data on the diagnosis, pathophysiology, and management of MS for the last 50 years. With every step of progress in immunology, imaging and biotechnology, there was indeed progress in our understanding of etiology and diagnosis of this potentially disabling disease. Even with such an amazing progress in technology, the exact etiology and absolute cure for MS is not known yet; thus, MS has been the focus of interest in clinical and basic science research in the past decades. Hundreds of MS research groups, centers and clinics are conducting research on this field ranging from animal studies to human clinical trials. Due to their interests and efforts, MS has become a partially treatable disease with the introduction of the drugs that are able to reduce annual relapse rates and delay disability.\n \nMS management starts with diagnosis and continues with strategies to control relapses, increasing quality of life of the patients, symptomatic treatments and rehabilitation. With our progress in this field, management of different patients has become more complicated and in some cases needs special training. These facts led the pioneer MS research centers around the world to start special MS training programs for neurologists for better management and addressing of the ever-growing issues about understanding, diagnosis and treatment of Multiple Sclerosis.  The moderate to high prevalence of MS in Iran (20-50 in 100,000) has led the local neurologist to pay special attention to patient management and research. Tehran University of Medical Sciences, as the leading medical university in Iran provides 18 months of advanced training in diagnosis, treatment and clinical research in Multiple Sclerosis. This Fellowship program is conducted under the supervision of neurologists specialized in MS atTehran University of Medical Sciences and the invited authorities from other countries.",

An active group is located in Department of Materials Science & Engineering at Jimma University, Ethiopia. The group is chaired by Professor Ali Eftekhari, President of the American Nano Society. \n\nWe have a unique strategy in leading the team. Thus, please carefully read the job description before applying. \n\n\n* This is part of a chair system in which assistant/associate professors work under supervision of a chair, and you will be officially appointed as an assistant or associate professor. This is indeed equivalent to the modern postdoc model in the United States and other countries. \n\n* You will work in a team of 15 - 20 postdoc fellows coming from different countries. \n\n* Due to the team structure, flexibility to be supervised is one of the main criteria. \n\n* Contrary to many postdoc fellowships, the present position is not focused on a specific research project. Instead, the postdoc fellows are involved in different tasks from research to academic affairs. The main theme is to empower the team members with various academic skills. \n\n* The postdoc fellows should necessarily start to work on a new research topic (different from their past experiences), and normally involved in literature review during the first six months. The goal is to publish review article or book. \n\n* The department is quite young, and you are part of the team developing the department. While initiatives have potential opportunities and excellent experiences for academic career, everything is not perfect. \n\n* We are looking for people who are ambitious and want to take this step as a jump in his/her academic career (e.g., appointment at top universities). There is no room for people who are interested in routine jobs for today. \n\n* A significant part of this position is teaching duties. \n\n* Each member should be committed to the team promotion internationally. Skills for networking are critically important. \n\n* The salary is about $24,000 - $30,000, which is quite high considering the cost of living (i.e. four times higher than local full professors). Housing and flights will be covered. On the other hand, we are looking for those who are interested in the potentials of this position rather than a routine job with high salary. \n\n* Jimma city is probably different from your imagination about Africa. The nature is greener than Europe, and the weather is always at excellent condition (18 - 25 C).\n\n\nApplication submitted from the present page will be considered only!\nView the link below.",

Although we welcome TOEFL and IELTS, they are not necessarily a condition of entry. A real ability to study in English is more important.\n\nTuition fees for the Master in International Security Studies program are set at 3,000 Euro per semester, payable at the start of each semester. \nThanks to a generous contribution from the Czech Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport, the Faculty of Social Sciences is able to offer a limited number of partial scholarships for students of the English-taught programs.

Although the disease was recognized in the 19th century, there were limited data on the diagnosis, pathophysiology, and management of MS until the last 50 years. With every step of progress in immunology, imaging and biotechnology, there was indeed progress in our understanding of etiology and diagnosis of this potentially disabling disease. Even with such an amazing progress in technology, the exact etiology and absolute cure for MS is not known yet, thus MS has been the focus of interest in clinical and basic science research in the past decades. Hundreds of MS research groups, centers and clinics are performing research on this field from animal studies to human clinical trials. Due to their interests and efforts, MS has become a partially treatable disease with introduction of the drugs that are able to reduce annual relapse rates and delayed disability.\n \nMS management starts with diagnosis and continues with strategies to control relapses, increasing quality of life of the patients, symptomatic treatments and rehabilitation. With our progress in this field, management of different patients has become more complicated and in some cases needs special training. These facts led the pioneer MS research centers around the world to start special MS training programs for neurologists for better management and addressing the ever-growing issues about understanding, diagnosis and treatment of multiple sclerosis.  The moderate to high prevalence of MS in Iran (20-50 in 100,000) has led the local neurologist to pay special attention to patient management and research. Tehran University of Medical Sciences, as the leading medical university in Iran provides  18 months of advanced training in diagnosis, treatment and clinical research in Multiple Sclerosis. This Fellowship program is conducted under the supervision of neurologists specialized in MS in Tehran University of Medical sciences and invited authorities from other countries.",
